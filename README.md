# Hardy-Weinberg Population Model
Graphs the effects of population on the p value of the Hardy-Weinberg equation across generations.

## Motivation

I had a project in AP Biology to create a model of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for Google Sheets. The original project was made in Google App Scripts, however for a local version, this side project began.

## Framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## How to use
Input starting with the initial P value and amount of generations to simulate. Afterwords just add the population sizes and watch the sample graph adapt to your new data. When you are ready, click the export button and import the csv to excel or google sheets for further analysis.
